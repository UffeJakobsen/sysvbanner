I took the program off Infomagic's Usenet CD-ROM (1994).

Copyright:
   This is a PD version of the SYS V banner program (at least I think 
   it is compatible to SYS V) which I wrote to use with the clock 
   program written by:
        DCF, Inc.
        14623 North 49th Place
        Scottsdale, AZ 85254
   and published in the net comp.sources.misc newsgroup in early July 
   since the BSD banner program works quite differently.
   
   There is no copyright or responsibility accepted for the use
   of this software.
